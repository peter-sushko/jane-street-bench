For a fixed p, independently label the nodes of an infinite complete binary tree 0 with
probability p, and 1 otherwise. For what p is there exactly a 1/2 probability that
there exists an infinite path down the tree that sums to at most 1 (that is, all nodes
visited, with the possible exception of one, will be labeled 0). Find this value of p
accurate to 10 decimal places.
